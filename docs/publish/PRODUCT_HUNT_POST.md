# Product Hunt Launch Post: PRISM

**Tagline**: Find any code in milliseconds using semantic search

**One-line description**: Lightning-fast semantic code search powered by Cloudflare Workers and Vectorize

---

## 🎯 Hunter's Note (if you have one)

> As a developer who spends hours searching through large codebases, I built PRISM to make code search instant and semantic. Instead of guessing function names, just describe what you're looking for in plain English.

---

## 📝 Main Description

## The Problem

Ever spent 20 minutes grepping through a codebase looking for that one authentication function... but you can't remember if it was called `login`, `auth`, `signin`, or something completely different?

Traditional code search is **keyword-based**:
- ❌ Misses code with different naming conventions
- ❌ Returns unranked results (good luck finding the right one)
- ❌ Slow on large codebases (seconds to minutes)
- ❌ No understanding of code intent

## The Solution

**PRISM** is semantic code search that understands **meaning**, not just keywords.

### How It Works

1. **Index your code**: Splits into 50-line chunks, generates embeddings
2. **Vectorize indexing**: Creates ANN index for sub-10ms vector search
3. **Semantic queries**: Search by intent, not exact words

### Example

```bash
# Instead of guessing function names
prism search "user authentication flow"

# Finds ALL related code, including:
- loginHandler()
- processCredentials()
- validateSession()
- OAuthCallback()
```

## ✨ Key Features

### ⚡ Blazing Fast
- **100K+ files**: Search in <400ms
- **Scales logarithmically**: 1M files still <500ms
- **177x faster** than grep at scale

### 🎯 Semantic Understanding
- Search by **intent**: "database connection pooling"
- Finds related code even with **different names**
- **Relevance scoring**: Best matches first

### 🆓 Free to Use
- Built on **Cloudflare Workers free tier**
- No infrastructure costs
- Deploy globally in seconds

### 🔍 Smart Filters
- Filter by language, path, date range
- Incremental indexing (21x faster reindex)
- SHA-256 change detection

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

| Scale | Grep | PRISM | Speedup |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 10K files | 7.0s | 378ms | **18x** |
| 100K files | 70s | 396ms | **177x** |
| 1M files | 11.6 min | 432ms | **1,600x** |

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g claudes-friend

# Index your project
prism index src/

# Search semantically
prism search "how to authenticate users"
```

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Onboarding**: New devs searching for "how payments work"
- **Code reviews**: Find all error handling logic
- **Refactoring**: Locate all database queries
- **Debugging**: Search for "file upload validation"
- **Learning**: Understand how features are implemented

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Cloudflare Workers** - Global edge deployment
- **Vectorize** - Vector ANN indexing
- **BGE-small-en-v1.5** - 384-dimensional embeddings
- **D1 Database** - Metadata storage

## 🎁 What's Next

- [ ] MCP server for Claude Code integration
- [ ] GPU acceleration for local embeddings
- [ ] Multi-repo namespace support
- [ ] Web UI for search visualization

## 💬 First Comment (Template)

> Hey Product Hunt! 👋
>
> I'm the creator of PRISM. After years of struggling with code search in large repositories, I built a semantic search engine that actually understands what you're looking for.
>
> **Why I built it:**
> - Spent hours grepping for "how auth works" in a new codebase
> - GitHub search is great but requires public repos
> - IDE search is keyword-only and misses relevant code
>
> **How it works:**
> PRISM uses vector embeddings (same tech behind ChatGPT) to understand code meaning. When you search "authentication", it finds login handlers, session validators, OAuth callbacks—even if none mention "auth" explicitly.
>
> **Built for:**
> - Developers navigating large codebases
> - Teams onboarding new members
> - Open source contributors
>
> Try it out and let me know what you think! Would love to hear your use cases and feedback.
>
> 🚀 **Happy hunting!**
>
> P.S. It's 100% free and runs on Cloudflare's generous free tier!

🎯 Excited to announce PRISM - semantic code search that understands meaning, not just keywords!

After struggling with code search in large repositories, I built a tool that:
• Searches 1M+ files in <500ms
• Finds code by intent (e.g., "authentication")
• Works on private repos for free
• Scales logarithmically using vector embeddings

Built on Cloudflare Workers and Vectorize, it's 177x faster than traditional grep at scale.

Try it: [Product Hunt Link]
